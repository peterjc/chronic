Chronic - Python Instrumentation
================================

Chronic is halfway between a simple timer and a profiler.  Add decorators or wrap code in with statements to get the execution time.  Chronic keeps track of the call hierarchy to tell you what timed blocks executed within other timed blocks.  Attach an event listener to log your timings however you want.

If you are looking for the command line tool ``chronic`` which silences stdout and stderr unless a command fails, see the [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) package.

## Installation

```
pip install chronic
```

## Usage

To time a block of code, you can use either the `@time` decorator or the `Timer` context manager.

```python
import chronic

@chronic.time
def long_running_method():
  # Do something here

with chronic.Timer('crunch_numbers'):
  # Crunch numbers here
```

### chronic.timings
At any point, you can get the information about completed timing info from `chronic.timings`.  This is a proxy to state held in a thread local about all timed blocks captured so far.

```python
>>> import chronic
>>> chronic.timings
{
  'long_running_method': {
    'total_elapsed': 3.068,
    'average_elapsed': 3.068,
    'count': 1
  },
  'crunch_numbers': {
    'total_elapsed': 1.884,
    'average_elapsed': 1.884,
    'count': 1
  }
}
```

`chronic.timings` is a dict with keys for each timed block of code.  If you use the context manager, you must specify a name.  When using the decorator, you may optionally specify the name, or chronic will use theh function name as a default.

Each timing is itself a dict with the following keys:

* `total_elapsed`: the elapsed execution time of the code (including all
  subtimings) for all runs of this block.  The unit is seconds by default.
  If you pass in your own clock function, the unit is whatever the unit of
  the clock.
* `count`: the number of times the timed block was run.
* `average_elapsed`: the average elapsed time for each run of this block.
* `timings`: a dict of all subtimings that were completed while inside this
  block.

So if you're using Django and want to log all timings to MongoDB, all you need to do is add middleware that looks something like this:
```python
import chronic
from pymongo import MongoClient

mongo_client = MongoClient()

class ProfilingMiddleware(object):
    def process_response(self, request, response):
        mongo_client.app.timings.insert(chronic.timings)
        return response
```

### chronic.stack
`chronic.stack` is a tuple of the names of all timed blocks in the call stack above the current context.

```python
>>> import chronic
>>> @chronic.time
>>> def time_two():
>>>     with chronic.Timer('block2'):
>>>         print chronic.stack
>>> time_two()
('time_two', 'block2')
```

### chronic.post_timing
Finally, you can install signal handlers to be called on the completion of all timings.
Here's how you might send all timing data to [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/):

```python
>>> import chronic
>>> from statsd import StatsClient
>>> statsd = StatsClient()
>>> def send_to_statsd(elapsed, timings, stack):
>>>     statsd.timing('.'.join(stack), elapsed * 1000)
>>> chronic.post_timing.connect(send_to_statsd)
```

## Examples

```python
import chronic
from pprint import pprint


@chronic.time
def time_one():
    pass


@chronic.time
def time_two():
    with chronic.Timer('block2'):
        print chronic.stack
        # ('time_two', 'block2')
    pprint(chronic.timings)
    # prints local view of timings
    # {'block2': {'average_elapsed': 1.0967254638671875e-05,
    #             'count': 1,
    #             'total_elapsed': 1.0967254638671875e-05}}

with chronic.Timer('block1'):
    time_one()

pprint(chronic.timings)


def print_done(elapsed, timings, stack):
    print stack
    pprint(timings)

time_one()
chronic.post_timing.connect(print_done)
time_one()
# []
# 9.5367431640625e-07
# {'average_elapsed': 9.5367431640625e-07,
#  'count': 2,
#  'total_elapsed': 1.9073486328125e-06}
chronic.post_timing.disconnect(print_done)


time_two()
# ['time_two', 'block2']
# {'block2': {'average_elapsed': 5.9604644775390625e-06,
#             'count': 1,
#             'total_elapsed': 5.9604644775390625e-06}}
```
